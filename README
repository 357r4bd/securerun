This is the reference implementation for USPTO Application 20060265469.

These files were extracted from HEAD in an old CVS repo I had backed up,
but no history is retained from before the import. I may make changes,
but this is really just to put the reference implementation on the record.

Abstract:

A method of creating an XML based framework to perform automated forecasting
includes sending a file from a local host computer to a remote computer,
receiving a file at the local host computer from the remote computer,
installing the received file on the local host computer, and executing commands
on the local host computer and the remote computer. Executing a command on
the remote computer includes reading a run file and a host definition file. A
framework for interacting between the local host computer and the remote
computer is determined based on types of XML tags, the XML tags including
at least one of a start of a tag, end of a tag, and text between the start
of a tag and the end of a tag. Computer program products for creating an
XML based framework to perform automated forecasting are also described.
