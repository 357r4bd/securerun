I am posting this because it's been 6 damn years in Limbo. In that time, a lot of shit has changed. In retrospect,
XML was a poor choice for the configuration "script" format, but such is life.

These files were extracted from HEAD in an old CVS repo I had backed up, but no history is retained from before the
import. I may make changes, but this is really just to put the reference implementation on the record.

Abstract:

A method of creating an XML based framework to perform automated forecasting includes sending a file from a local 
host computer to a remote computer, receiving a file at the local host computer from the remote computer, installing 
the received file on the local host computer, and executing commands on the local host computer and the remote 
computer. Executing a command on the remote computer includes reading a run file and a host definition file. A 
framework for interacting between the local host computer and the remote computer is determined based on types of 
XML tags, the XML tags including at least one of a start of a tag, end of a tag, and text between the start of a tag 
and the end of a tag. Computer program products for creating an XML based framework to perform automated forecasting
are also described.
