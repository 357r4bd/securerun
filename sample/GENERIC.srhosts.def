#### HOST INFORMATION
#  For right now this host config file
#  is not really for the faint of heart
#  since it is purely a perl hash of
#  hashes of hashes and arrays, etc;
#
#  NOTE: this file is not intended for nor will it
#  utilize any sensitive host information
#  such as usernames or passwords, so DO NOT INCLUDE
#  such information here!
#  Caution about assigning "flags":
#    Only assign flags that are allowed immediately after the command;
#    Ideally, no flags should be assigned, but the option is there
#    for the unusual cirumstance that you would want to force them.
